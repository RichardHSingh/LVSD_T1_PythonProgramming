#============== LOOPS =====================

# creating a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
# variable is 1 and as long as var is under 10, will increment by 1
x = 1
while x <= 10:
    print(x, end = " ")
    x +=1


    #==================================================================#

# same as aobve but this time we using FUNCTION to do the same

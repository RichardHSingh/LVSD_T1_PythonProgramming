# PROBLEM SOLVING
def calculate_area(radius):
    # calc area of circle with given formula
    area = 3.14 * radius ** 2

    # return the calculated area from given parameter
    return area
    #area variable wasnt called

calculate_area(5)
# parameter is what radius would be
# in this case its 5

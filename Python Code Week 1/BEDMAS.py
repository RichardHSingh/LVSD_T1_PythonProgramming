#============== MATHMETICS VARIABLE =====================
# Given the expression a = 5 * 2 + 3, calculate the value of ‘a’ using operator precedence.
# Explain the steps in a comment in your code.

a = 5 * 2 + 3
print(a)

# Simple BEDMAS - Multiplication comes before addition
# Therefore 5 * 2 = 10 is summed up first
# Then you get subtotal of 10 add 3 = 13
# answer is 13

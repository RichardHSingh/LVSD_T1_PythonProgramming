#============== PROBLEM SOLVING =====================
# Program 2

x = 5
# y = "10"
y = 10

# setting variable of result to calculation x = y then printing it
result = x + y
print("Result:", result)

#============== SOLUTION =====================
# y value was a string rather than int so one cannot add two together expecting a int return
# ended up chaning y to int
